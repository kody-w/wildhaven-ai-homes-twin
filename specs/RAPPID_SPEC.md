> **Refresh (2026-07-15):** identity/mint sections are SUPERSEDED by RAPP/1 §6 — canonical `rappid:@owner/slug:64hex`, keyless mint `Hb("rapp/1:rappid", uuid4)`; the `rappid:v2:...@host` form shown below is legacy, read-forever, never emitted. See https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/rapp-1/main/SPEC.md

# RAPPID_SPEC — Identity (Eternity)

> **Frozen excerpt** of the canonical rappid contract (`rapp/1`). Bundled at planting time on 2026-05-09T12:52:19Z. Format consolidated to the Eternity form per Constitution Art. XXXIV.1 (locked 2026-06-03).

## Format

```
rappid:@<owner>/<slug>:<hex>
```

One self-locating string. No `v2:`/`v3:` prefix, no inline `<kind>` segment, no
trailing `@github.com/...` suffix — `github.com/<owner>/<slug>` is the door,
derived from `@<owner>/<slug>` by string parsing. `kind` lives in the
`rappid.json` **record** (a field), not the string.

Example (this neighborhood's):

```
rappid:@kody-w/wildhaven-ai-homes-twin:<hex>
```

(See `../rappid.json` for the actual value.)

Every legacy form is read forever and canonicalized (`tools/door_address.py::canonicalize_rappid`); only the Eternity form is emitted. The prior forms were:

```
v1  <uuid>                                                              (bare UUID — not self-locating)
v2  rappid:v2:<kind>:@<owner>/<repo>:<32-hex>@github.com/<owner>/<repo>  (envelope-decorated)
```

## Components

| Part | Rule |
|---|---|
| Prefix `rappid:` | Literal. |
| `@<owner>/<slug>` | The GitHub composite identity and canonical location. The `@` prefix is literal and required. `github.com/<owner>/<slug>` is the door. |
| `<hex>` | The identity hash (lowercase hex). Minted ONCE at planting; permanent thereafter. Grandfathered 32-hex (UUID4, dashes stripped) is preserved as-is and never regenerated. |
| `kind` | NOT in the string — carried in the `rappid.json` record. One of: `neighborhood`, `ant-farm`, `braintrust`, `workspace`, `twin`, `prototype`. |

## Invariants (Constitution Art. XXXIV.5)

1. **Permanence.** Once minted, a rappid is permanent for the lifetime of the neighborhood. Re-grafting, re-planting, kernel upgrades — none of these mint a new rappid.
2. **Bond preservation.** The bond technique (egg → overlay → hatch back) preserves the rappid through every kernel upgrade.
3. **Lineage chain.** A neighborhood's `parent_rappid` chains back to its ancestor (the species root for many: `rappid:@kody-w/rapp:9a8f0a4b5a710e20f4d819a0f37d2a4c9f113b5e78fb3c29e70b54fff48a38f9`).
4. **No two organisms share a rappid.** Mint the 64-hex tail via `Hb("rapp/1:rappid", uuid4_bytes)` (RAPP/1 §6.2, keyless, domain-separated) — NEVER `uuid4().hex` (only 32 hex) and NEVER `sha256(owner/slug)` (the cardinal sin).
5. **The rappid is the seed source for the neighborhood's holocard.** `derive_seed(rappid_str)` via BLAKE2b-64 produces a deterministic 64-bit ID. Same rappid → same seed → same incantation, forever.

## Required fields in `../rappid.json` (`rapp/1`)

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `schema`       | yes | `rapp/1` |
| `rappid`       | yes | The full Eternity string `rappid:@<owner>/<slug>:<hex>` |
| `kind`         | yes | One of the 6 kinds above (carried here in the record, not in the string) |
| `name`         | yes | Slug — matches the repo name |
| `display_name` | yes | Human-readable |
| `github`       | yes | `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>` |
| `parent_rappid`| yes (may be null for species roots) | The lineage anchor |
| `parent_repo`  | yes | Where the parent's rappid lives |
| `planted_by`   | yes | GitHub handle of the operator who planted |
| `planted_at`   | yes | ISO-8601 UTC |
| `kernel_version` | yes | The kernel version at planting time |

## Don't

- Don't change the rappid after minting — that's identity destruction. Use a new rappid for a new neighborhood instead.
- Don't synthesize rappids by hand — always mint via UUID4.
- Don't include personal data in the rappid — it travels publicly.
- Don't reuse a rappid string across neighborhoods (uniqueness is critical for seed derivation).
